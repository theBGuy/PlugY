# Changelog fragments

Instead of editing `## [Unreleased]` in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)
directly, where every branch collides, each user-facing change adds its **own
file** here. One file per change means parallel branches never conflict on the
changelog. At a stable release, `node scripts/changelog-release.mjs <version>`
assembles these fragments into `CHANGELOG.md`, in the exact
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format, and deletes them. A
pre-release (`-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) leaves them in place: its release
notes, and the `CHANGELOG.md` in its zip and installer, are rendered from them,
and the stable release consumes them later.

**Player-facing changes only.** The release notes on GitHub come from this
changelog, so write for players and bot operators. Build scripts, CI, and repo
tooling get **no fragment**.

CI keys on paths, not user impact: the PR check fires on any change under
`src/`, `game-files/` or `installer/`, so a change there that genuinely needs no
fragment (an internal refactor, say) takes the `no-changelog` label or
`skip-changelog` in the PR title.

## Format

Create a file named **`<category>-<slug>.md`**, where:

- `<category>` is one of `added`, `changed`, or `fixed` (the Keep a Changelog
  groups this project uses: `feat` → `added`, `fix` → `fixed`, refactors/perf →
  `changed`). A pending `added-*` fragment makes the release driver suggest a
  minor version.
- `<slug>` is a short kebab-case topic. Keep it distinctive; append the PR number
  if you want to be certain it's unique (e.g. `added-shared-stash-locking-42.md`).

The **file body is the finished changelog bullet, verbatim**, including the
leading `- ` and the 2-space indent on wrapped continuation lines. Write it *for
humans*: a clear sentence about what changed for the player, not your commit
subject. State what the change gives the reader, not the defect it removes, and
open with a short **bold lead** naming it, so the release notes can be skimmed:
`- **Safer stash saves.** PlugY writes ...`. The assembler concatenates bodies
under the right `###` heading without re-wrapping, so what you write is exactly
what `CHANGELOG.md` gets. GitHub breaks a release body at every newline, so the
release body joins each wrapped line back onto its bullet, as long as the line
holds plain text. What it leaves as written:

- A wrapped line starting with `>`, `# ` or a list marker, or the line after a
  `code span` that crosses a line break: that line and the rest of its bullet.
- A wrapped line starting with `<` or `|`, or a link definition: that line and
  every later line up to the next blank one, so the rest of its `###` group.
- A code fence, a `$$` line, a raw HTML block, or a `<pre>`, `<code>` or
  `<textarea>` tag still open at the end of its group (even inside backticks):
  everything from there to the end of the release notes.

So rewrap to move such a word off the start of a line, keep each code span on
one line, and keep those three tag names out of fragments.

Use at most one em dash per bullet; two read as a paired aside and fail
`--check`. Em dashes inside backticks, **bold**, or "quotes" don't count, so
quoted game text can keep its own.

### Example: `added-show-error-message-box.md`

```md
- **`ShowErrorMessageBox` option** in the `[GENERAL]` section of `PlugY.ini`, for
  unattended bots. Set it to 0 and the errors `PlugY.dll` raises in the game are
  reported without a message box waiting for a click.
```

### Example: `fixed-autosave-stash-files.md`

```md
- **Stashes save with the character.** In single-player games on Diablo II
  1.14d, the PlugY stash (`.d2x`) and the shared stash are saved with the
  character every time the game saves it.
```

## Commands

- `node scripts/changelog-draft.mjs --preview` shows the pending fragments
  assembled under an Unreleased heading (nothing is written).
- `node scripts/changelog-draft.mjs --check` validates every pending fragment
  (filename + bullet format) and reports all problems; the PR workflow runs
  this, so a malformed fragment fails the PR instead of the release.
- `node scripts/changelog-draft.mjs` drafts starting-point bullets from the git
  history since the last stable release tag (curate before saving as a
  fragment, opening it with a bold lead in place of any drafted `**scope:**`
  prefix).
- `node scripts/release.mjs` (maintainers) is the interactive release driver:
  it checks the repo state, previews the fragments, picks the version (patch,
  minor, major or a pre-release), runs `changelog-release.mjs`, then commits,
  creates the annotated tag, and pushes master and the tag together. Rehearse
  with `--dry-run`; `--help` lists the options.
- `node scripts/changelog-release.mjs <version>` (maintainers) stamps the version
  into `src/common/PlugYVersion.h` and the version banners of the INIs,
  `LocalizedStrings.ini` and readmes in `game-files/`; for a stable version it
  also assembles the fragments into `CHANGELOG.md` as `## [<version>] - <date>`
  and deletes them.
- `node scripts/changelog-extract.mjs <tag>` prints the release notes for a tag
  (the release workflow uses it for the GitHub release body), with wrapped
  paragraph and bullet lines joined. A pre-release's notes, like its packaged
  `CHANGELOG.md`, open with a paragraph that names the newest stable version in
  `CHANGELOG.md` (or "the last stable release" when it has none) and says that
  the pre-release's installer turns on full session logs (`PRERELEASE_LOGS` in
  `scripts/changelog-lib.mjs`).
- `node scripts/changelog-package.mjs <pre-release version> <output file>`
  writes the `CHANGELOG.md` a pre-release's zip and installer ship: the
  repository's file plus a section for that version built from the pending
  fragments (`scripts/package.ps1` runs it; nothing in the tree changes).

`README.md` in this directory is ignored by the tooling and never consumed.
