- **Crash-safe character saves.** On Diablo II 1.14d, a single-player save that
  doesn't touch the shared stash now lands whole: whenever the game crashes or a
  bot manager kills it, the next load finds the complete new save or the
  complete previous one, with the character and its PlugY stash (`.d2x`) always
  matching. After a kill late in a save, the next load finishes that save and
  stops once at "Unable to enter game"; loading again works, and D2Bot retries
  on its own. Two single-player games can't run the same character at once. On
  by default for new installs and upgrades; setting `ActiveCrashSafeSaves=0`
  in the `[SAVEPATH]` section of `PlugY.ini` brings back the old save writer.
