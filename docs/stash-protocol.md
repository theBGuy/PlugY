# Stash protocol for scripts (Diablo II 1.14d)

A bot or script can drive PlugY's multi-page stash without ever leaving its home page. It can show any page,
list what every page holds, and move a stash item to any page by its gid, with one request each and an answer
it can wait for. The items on the page shown never leave D2BS's view, so references to them (the Horadric Cube
above all) stay valid.

kolbot's own client for this protocol ships separately from PlugY4Kolbot. This page is the wire reference
for anyone writing a client.

## Requirements

- Diablo II 1.14d, single player or a TCP/IP game hosted by PlugY4Kolbot. Never on realms.
- `[STASH] ActiveMultiPageStash=1` and `ActiveStashProtocol=1` (the default) in PlugY.ini.
- D2BS with `EnableUnsupported=true`, so scripts can call `sendPacket`.
- A TCP/IP joiner must run PlugY4Kolbot with the same stash grid as the host. Otherwise the host refuses its
  requests with `CLIENT_MISMATCH`, rather than letting its view of the stash go stale.

## 1. Handshake

Send the 3-byte packet `3A 3A seq` (`US_PY_HELLO`, `seq` any byte you choose). The server answers with a
`UC_PROTO` message, then a `UC_ACK` whose op is `0x80`.

Before sending any request:
- The ACK's feature bit `0x10` must be set. Without it, never send a `0x55` packet: a host without
  PlugY4Kolbot stalls on it. Upstream PlugY or a vanilla host doesn't answer HELLO at all; a short timeout is
  the answer.
- The ACK's `clientProto` must be 1 or more, and `clientGridMatch` 1. The client PlugY confirms the protocol
  when it receives the join-time `UC_PROTO`, so a HELLO sent right after joining can come back with
  `clientProto` 0. Wait a moment and send HELLO again (each HELLO re-sends `UC_PROTO`).

## 2. Requests: packet `0x55`, exactly 16 bytes, little-endian

| Byte | Field |
|---|---|
| 0 | `0x55` |
| 1 | op |
| 2 | seq (echoed in the answer) |
| 3 | flags |
| 4-7 | item gid (D2BS `item.gid`) for MOVE, else 0 |
| 8-11 | page id (0 = the first page). LIST: the first page listed |
| 12 | x (MOVE without `AUTO`) |
| 13 | y |
| 14-15 | LIST: most pages listed (0 = no limit), else 0 |

| Op | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | MOVE | Moves stash item *gid* to page *id* (or the page shown with `CURRENT`) at x,y (or the first free spot with `AUTO`). The page shown doesn't change. |
| `0x02` | SELECT | Shows page *id*, creating missing pages up to it. With `CURRENT` it only reports the page shown. |
| `0x03` | LIST | Sends a `UC_STASH_PAGE` message per page (more than one for a page with over 26 items), then the ACK. |

| Flag | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | SHARED | The page is on the shared list (SELECT, MOVE target, LIST). |
| `0x02` | AUTO | MOVE: the first free spot, column by column from (0,0); x and y are ignored. |
| `0x04` | ALLOW_PINNED | MOVE: a pinned item (see `PinnedItems`) may move. |
| `0x08` | CURRENT | The page shown (page id and SHARED ignored). |
| `0x10` | CROSS | MOVE: the item may change list (personal <-> shared). |
| `0x20` | WITH_EMPTY | LIST: also list the empty pages after the last page with items. |
| `0x40` | ALLOW_SHARED | MOVE: a shared page may be the source or the target. |
| `0x80` | reserved | Must be 0. |

A flag an op doesn't use is refused with `BAD_REQUEST`.

## 3. Answers: `0x9D` messages

Each `0x9D` message's size is its byte +2. Parse by that, never by the length of the event array: one event can
hold several messages. Bytes +04..+07 are always 0.

### `UC_ACK` (+01 = `0x21`, 36 bytes): one per request

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| +03 | seq |
| +08 | op (`0x80` for HELLO) |
| +09 | status (table below) |
| +0A | protocol version (1) |
| +0B | features (table below) |
| +0C, +0D | server stash grid width, height |
| +0E | the version this client's PlugY confirmed (0 = none yet) |
| +0F | 1 when the client's grid matches the server's |
| +10 (4) | MOVE: the item gid; LIST: the number of pages sent |
| +14, +15 | MOVE: the item's final x, y |
| +18 (4) | MOVE: the item's final page id; others: the page shown |
| +1C (4) | page flags: `0x01` shared, `0x02` index, `0x04` main index, `0x100` the page shown, `0x200` SELECT changed nothing |
| +20, +22 (2 each) | number of personal pages, shared pages |

Match an ACK by op and seq, and for MOVE also by gid. A request gets no ACK when the player is dead (the game
drops it) or has no PlugY data, so always use a timeout.

| Status | Name | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | OK | Done. |
| 1 | NOOP | Already there. A MOVE also re-sends where the item is (see repair, below). |
| 2 | NOT_FOUND | No item with that gid. |
| 3 | NOT_IN_STASH | The item is in the inventory, belt, cube or equipped. MOVE only takes stash items: put it on the page shown with a normal move first. |
| 4 | PINNED | Pinned item; set ALLOW_PINNED to move it anyway. |
| 5 | PAGE_RANGE | Beyond `MaxPersonnalPages` / `MaxSharedPages`. Nothing was created. |
| 6 | NO_ROOM | No room at x,y, or no free spot with AUTO. Nothing changed and no page was created. |
| 7 | FEATURE_OFF | Multi-page stash off, shared stash off or not loaded, or a shared page without ALLOW_SHARED. |
| 8 | BUSY | The game holds the item for a moment; retry after about 100 ms. |
| 9 | BAD_REQUEST | Unknown op or flag. |
| 10 | CROSS_LIST | A personal <-> shared move without CROSS. |
| 11 | INTERNAL | Should not happen. The item stays where it was or where a page switch would put it; the session log in PlugY\logs says why. |
| 12 | CLIENT_MISMATCH | The client hasn't confirmed the protocol, or its grid differs. Send HELLO again, then retry. |
| 13 | SHARED_CONFLICT | Shared moves are refused because the shared stash is in conflict. A running game doesn't send it: PlugY reports a conflict only in the save made when the player leaves. |

| Feature bit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x01` | Multi-page stash on, with pages for this character (SELECT can work) |
| `0x02` | Shared stash on |
| `0x04` | This game loaded the shared stash |
| `0x08` | This game loaded the personal stash |
| `0x10` | Packet `0x55` is installed: requests may be sent |
| `0x20` | Swaps keep pinned items on their page |
| `0x40` | The shared stash is in conflict (set only by the save made when the player leaves, so a running game doesn't see it) |
| `0x80` | Page insert/delete keeps this client's pages in step |

### `UC_ITEM_MOVED` (+01 = `0x20`, 36 bytes)

Sent before a MOVE's ACK, and on its own (seq 0) when a page switch had to put an item somewhere else. The
client's PlugY applies it to its own copy of the item, so a script only needs it to know what happened.

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| +03 | the request's seq, 0 when unsolicited |
| +08 | source flags: `0x01` shared, `0x02` it left the page shown, `0x04` source unknown |
| +09 | target flags: `0x01` shared |
| +0A | reason: 0 a MOVE, 1 repair (the item was already there), 2 relocated by a page switch |
| +10 (4) | gid |
| +14, +15 | x, y |
| +18 (4) | target page id |
| +1C (4) | source page id (`0xFFFFFFFF` = unknown) |

### `UC_STASH_PAGE` (+01 = `0x22`, `0x28 + 8 * n` bytes, at most 248)

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| +03 | seq |
| +08 (4) | page id |
| +0C (4) | page flags (as in the ACK) |
| +10, +11 | chunk index, chunk count (1 for an empty page) |
| +12 | n, the items in this chunk (at most 26) |
| +14 (20) | page name as saved, NUL padded (no NUL when it is 20 characters long), empty when unnamed; a page PlugY adds for items that no longer fit is `Moved items` in every game language |
| +28 | n records of 8 bytes: gid (4), classid (2), x, y |

Plain LIST sends every page from the first one asked for up to the last page with items, empty pages in
between included. `WITH_EMPTY` adds the empty pages after it.

### `UC_PROTO` (+01 = `0x23`) and `UC_PAGE_OP` (+01 = `0x24`)

Both are for the client's own PlugY. `UC_PROTO` carries the version, the stash grid and the pinned item codes;
`UC_PAGE_OP` tells the client a page was inserted or deleted. A script can ignore both.

## 4. Rules that keep items safe

- Register the `gamepacket` listener only while a request waits, and always return `false` from it: returning
  `true` drops the rest of that receive buffer, PlugY's messages included.
- MOVE is idempotent. If its answer is lost, send the same MOVE again: it answers NOOP and re-sends where the
  item is (`UC_ITEM_MOVED` reason 1), which also repairs the client's view.
- Items on hidden pages are out of `me.getItems()`, but `getUnit(4, -1, -1, gid)` still finds each one. Use
  LIST to know where they are.
- Insert and delete page requests (`/insertpage`, `/deletepage`, or the raw `0x3A` packets) are run by the
  server, which then tells the client, so the pages a script sees always match the pages saved.
- With `PinnedItems` (`box` by default), swapping pages leaves pinned items where they are on both pages, and a
  swap that would put a pinned item and another item on the same cells is refused.
- Known limit: PlugY reports a shared stash conflict only when the player leaves the game. Once another game has
  saved the shared stash after this one loaded it, a shared move this game makes ends up in the conflict file written
  when leaving, not in the main file, and once this game has changed the shared stash its character saves wait until
  then. Shared moves therefore need explicit flags, and kolbot never makes them.
